# Customer Interview Notes

## Interview: Vamshi Alla

| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Interview Type** | Qualitative User Interview |
| **User Segment** | Renter / Roommate-Seeker (Relocating) |
| **Objective** | Understand how users currently find roommates or shared housing when relocating and identify key pain points and unmet needs |

---

## Current Behavior

### When the user has existing connections
- Relies on university groups, alumni networks, or cultural WhatsApp groups to find roommates
- If someone in their network knows a person in the destination city, the user is added to a local group
- Finds housing through informal introductions

### When the user does not have connections
- Relies on platforms such as Sulekha, Facebook groups, and WhatsApp groups
- Discovery across these channels is unstructured, manual, and repetitive

### Platform Usage by Stay Duration

| Duration | Platforms Used |
|----------|---------------|
| **Short-term** | Airbnb (despite higher costs) |
| **Long-term** | Zillow, apartment listing platforms + online reviews |

---

## Key Pain Points

### 1. Safety and Trust
> Platforms such as Sulekha and Facebook groups lack verification, accountability, and safety guarantees, creating a high perceived risk of scams or misrepresentation.

### 2. Over-reliance on Networks
> Success depends heavily on whether the user knows someone locally. Users without connections face limited options and increased uncertainty.

### 3. Insufficient Listing Detail
> Existing listings rarely provide information critical to decision-making, such as:
> - Flooring type
> - Facilities
> - Household dynamics
> - Cleanliness
> - Noise levels
> - Cultural norms

### 4. Remote Decision Challenges
> When relocating across states, users cannot visit properties in person and struggle to find reliable virtual tours or direct ways to speak with hosts or roommates.

## Unmet Needs

| **Rich Listings** | Lifestyle-oriented listing information beyond basics |
| **Direct Communication** | Ability to speak directly with a real person before committing, preferably through video |
| **Network Independence** | Reduced dependence on informal networks and social connections |

## User Story: Maya (Renter / Roommate-Seeker)

Maya is a graduate student relocating to a new state for school. She does not have friends or family in the area and is unfamiliar with the local housing market.

### Background
In the past, she has relied on:
- University WhatsApp groups
- Facebook groups
- Platforms such as Sulekha

These channels feel unsafe and unreliable due to the lack of verification and accountability.

### What Maya Wants
- A room or shared apartment with roommates who align with her lifestyle and cultural expectations
- Safety and understanding of what living in the space would actually be like, including:
  - Facilities
  - Flooring
  - Cleanliness
  - Who she would be living with

### Challenges
- Relocating from another state
- Cannot visit properties in person
- Wants a reliable way to view listings in depth
- Wants to speak directly with a host or roommate before committing

### Desired Solution
A structured and trustworthy platform that replaces informal group-based discovery with a consent-based process.

## Key Insights for Product

### Design Implications

| Insight | Product Feature |
|---------|-----------------|
| Trust is the primary barrier | Verification badges, structured profiles, consent-based connections |
| Network dependency excludes many users | Open discovery without requiring referrals or connections |
| Listings lack lifestyle details | Rich listing fields: flooring, cleanliness, household norms, photos |
| Remote users need virtual presence | In-platform video calls as a core feature |
| Scam risk is high on informal channels | Platform-native communication, no off-platform contact until trust established |

### Competitive Positioning

| Current Options | Nivaesa Advantage |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Sulekha: unverified, scam-prone | Verified profiles, moderation |
| Facebook/WhatsApp: fragmented, unstructured | Centralized, filterable search |
| Zillow: lacks cultural context | Lifestyle and cultural preference filters |
| Airbnb: expensive for longer stays | Designed for mid/long-term with escrow protection |

## Future Research Recommendations

1. **Interview hosts/landlords** to understand their pain points and willingness to pay
2. **Test price sensitivity** for verification and premium features
3. **Validate video call adoption** — is it seen as essential or friction?
4. **Explore group housing needs** — do users want to find roommates together before finding a place?
